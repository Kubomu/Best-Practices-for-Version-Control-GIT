# Commit Message Best Practices

Writing clear and concise commit messages is essential for collaboration. Here are some guidelines for writing effective commit messages.

## Structure:
1. **Use the present tense**: Describe what the commit does, not what it did. (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").
2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters**: Keep it short and to the point.
3. **Capitalize the first letter** of the subject line.
4. **Use a body**: Provide further explanation, especially if the commit is complex.
5. **Use a footer**: Reference issue numbers or any related information.

## Example:

Add user authentication feature

Implemented user login and registration forms.
Used JWT for token-based authentication.
Updated database schema to store user information.


### Why It Matters:
- Well-written commit messages make it easier to understand project history.
- They help team members quickly find relevant changes and issues.
