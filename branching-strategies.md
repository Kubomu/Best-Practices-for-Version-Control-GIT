# Branching Strategies

Effective branching strategies can help keep your project organized and enable smooth collaboration. Here are some common strategies:

## 1. Feature Branches
Each new feature should be developed in its own branch, separate from `main` or `develop`.

### Steps:
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Commit your changes regularly.
3. Merge the feature branch back into `main` or `develop`.

## 2. Release Branches
A release branch allows you to prepare for a new version of your software without interrupting ongoing development.

### Steps:
1. Create a release branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b release/v1.0 develop`
2. Perform final testing and bug fixes.
3. Merge the release branch into `main` and tag the release.

## 3. Hotfix Branches
Hotfixes are quick fixes for production issues that should be applied immediately.

### Steps:
1. Create a hotfix branch from `main`: `git checkout -b hotfix/v1.1 main`
2. Apply the fix and commit.
3. Merge the hotfix branch into both `main` and `develop`.
