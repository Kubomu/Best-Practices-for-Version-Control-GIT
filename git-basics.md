# Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage your project's history.

## Key Concepts:
- **Repository**: A directory containing your project and its version history.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in your project at a specific point in time.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development in your project.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.

## Common Git Commands:
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes to a file for commit.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory.
- `git log`: View the commit history.

## Helpful Tips:
- Always check the status with `git status` before committing.
- Keep commits small and focused on a single change or feature.
